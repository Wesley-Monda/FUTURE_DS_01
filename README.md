# IMDb Top 1000 Movies Data Analysis

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project analyzes the **IMDb Top 1000 Movies Dataset**, which contains data on popular movies such as IMDb ratings, genres, runtime, gross earnings, and more. The objective of this project is to clean the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and create visualizations to derive insights into trends and patterns in the dataset.

## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning

In this project, the dataset required several cleaning steps:
- **Missing Data Handling**: Filled missing values in columns such as **Certificate** and **Meta_score**.
- **Data Type Conversion**: Converted columns like **Released_Year** and **Gross** to appropriate numeric types.
- **Runtime Extraction**: Extracted numerical values from the **Runtime** column.
- **Genre Handling**: Split multiple genres in the **Genre** column for individual analysis.

## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key insights drawn from the analysis:
- **Top 10 Most Popular Genres**: Analyzed the most common genres in the dataset.
- **Gross Earnings vs. IMDb Rating**: Explored the relationship between IMDb ratings and gross earnings.
- **Top Genres by Gross Earnings**: Calculated the total gross earnings per genre and identified the highest-earning genres.

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations

Created visualizations to communicate insights:
- **Bar chart** showing the top 10 most popular genres.
- **Scatter plot** representing the relationship between IMDb ratings and gross earnings.
- **Bar chart** visualizing total earnings by genre.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**: Main programming language used for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: Data visualization tools.

## ðŸ“š Key Learnings

- Mastered data cleaning techniques like handling missing data and type conversion.
- Gained hands-on experience in **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.
- Learned how to visualize complex data using Python libraries.

## ðŸ’¡ Future Enhancements

- **Predictive Models**: Extend the analysis to include machine learning models that predict movie success.
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Implement interactive dashboards using **Plotly** or **Dash**.
